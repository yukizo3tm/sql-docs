# Vector data type (preview)

[!INCLUDE [Azure SQL Database](../../includes/applies-to-version/asdb.md)]

The **vector** data type is designed to store vector data optimized for operations such as similarity search and machine learning applications. Vectors are stored in an optimized binary format but are exposed as JSON arrays for convenience. Each element of the vector is stored as a single-precision (4-byte) floating-point value.

> [!NOTE]
> This data type is in preview and is subject to change. Make sure to read preview usage terms in the [Service Level Agreements (SLA) for Online Services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services) document. For limitations of the current preview, see [Limitations](#limitations) and [Known issues](#known-issues).

For more information on working with Vector data in SQL Database, see:

- [Intelligent applications with Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/ai-artificial-intelligence-intelligent-applications#vector-search)

## Sample syntax

The usage syntax for the **vector** type is similar to all other SQL Server data types in a table.

```syntaxsql
column_name VECTOR( {<dimensions>} ) [NOT NULL | NULL] 
```

#### Dimensions

A vector must have at least one dimension. The maximum number of dimensions supported is 1998.

## Examples

### A. Column definition

The **vector** type can be used in column definition contained in a `CREATE TABLE` statement, for example:

The following example creates a table with a vector column and inserts data into it.

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.vectors
(
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  v VECTOR(3) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO dbo.vectors (id, v) VALUES 
(1, '[0.1, 2, 30]'),
(2, '[-100.2, 0.123, 9.876]');

SELECT * FROM dbo.vectors;
```

### B. Usage in variables

The following example declares vectors using the new **vector** data type and calculates distances using the `VECTOR_DISTANCE` function.

The **vector** type can be used with variables:

```sql
DECLARE @v VECTOR(3) = '[0.1, 2, 30]';
SELECT @v;
```

### C. Usage in stored procedures or functions

The **vector** data type can be used as parameter in stored procedure or functions. For example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SampleStoredProcedure
@V VECTOR(3),
@V2 VECTOR(3) OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT @V;
    SET @V2 = @V;
END
```

## Feature availability

The native support for vectors is currently in preview in Azure SQL Database.

The new **vector** type is available under all database compatibility levels.

## Compatibility

To allow all clients to be able to operate on vector data, vectors are exposed as **varchar(max)** types. Client applications can work with vector data as if it was a JSON Array. The engine will automatically convert vectors to and from a JSON array, making the new type transparent for the client. Thanks to this approach all drivers and all languages are automatically compatible with the new type.

You can start to use the new vector type right away. Here's some examples:

### [C#](#tab/csharp-sample)

With C#, vectors can be serialized and deserialized to and from string using the `JsonSerializer` class.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient;
using Dapper;
using DotNetEnv;
using System.Text.Json;

namespace DotNetSqlClient;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Env.Load();

        var v1 = new float[] { 1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f };

        using var conn = new SqlConnection(Env.GetString("MSSQL"));
        conn.Execute("INSERT INTO dbo.vectors VALUES(100, @v)", param: new {@v = JsonSerializer.Serialize(v1)});

        var r = conn.ExecuteScalar<string>("SELECT v FROM dbo.vectors") ?? "[]";
        var v2 = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<float[]>(r); 
        Console.WriteLine(JsonSerializer.Serialize(v2));          
    }
}
```

### [Python](#tab/python-sample)

With Python, applications can write and read vector data using `json.loads` and `json.dumps`:

```python
import json
from utilities import get_conn

conn = get_conn()

cursor = conn.cursor()
query = "INSERT INTO dbo.vectors VALUES(100, ?)"
cursor.execute(query, json.dumps([1,2,3]))
cursor.close()

cursor = conn.cursor()
query = "SELECT v FROM dbo.vectors"
cursor.execute(query)
rows = cursor.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(json.loads(row[0]))
cursor.close()

conn.close()
```

For more information on the `get_conn` function, see [Migrate a Python application to use passwordless connections with Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/azure-sql-passwordless-migration-python?view=azuresql&preserve-view=true&tabs=sign-in-azure-cli%2Cazure-portal-create%2Cazure-portal-assign%2Capp-service-identity#update-the-local-connection-configuration).

## Limitations

The ongoing preview has the following limitations:

### Tables

- Column-level constraints are not supported, except for `NULL`/`NOT NULL` constraints.
  - `DEFAULT` and `CHECK` constraints are not supported for **vector** columns.
  - Key constraints, such as `PRIMARY KEY` or `FOREIGN KEY`, are not supported for **vector** columns. Equality, uniqueness, joins using vector columns as keys, and sort orders do not apply to **vector** data types.
  - There is no notion of uniqueness for vectors, so unique constraints are not applicable.
  - Checking the range of values within a vector is also not applicable.
- Vectors do not support comparison, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, concatenation, or any other mathematical, logical, and compound assignment operators.
- **vector** columns cannot be used in memory-optimized tables.
- Altering **vector** columns using `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN` to other data types is not permitted.

### Table schema metadata

- [sp_describe_first_result_set](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-describe-first-result-set-transact-sql.md) system stored procedure doesn't correctly return the **vector** data type. Therefore, many data access clients and driver see a **varchar** or **nvarchar** data type.
- `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` reports columns using **vector** type as **varbinary**. A workaround to get the correct data type is to use `sys.columns` system view.
- `sys.columns` returns length of vector in bytes. To get the number of dimensions, use the following formula:

  ```sql
  dimensions = (length - 8) / 4
  ```

  where `length` is the value returned by `max_length`. For example, if you see a `max_length` of 20 bytes, the number of dimensions is (20 - 8) / 4 = 3.

### Conversions

- Implicit and explicit conversion using `CAST` or `CONVERT` from the **vector** type can be done to **varchar**, and **nvarchar** types Similarly, only  **varchar**, and **nvarchar** can be implicitly or explicitly converted to the **vector** type.
- The **vector** type can't be used with the **sql_variant** type or assigned to a **sql_variant** variable or column. This restriction similar to **varchar(max)**, **varbinary(max)**, **nvarchar(max)**, **xml**, **json**, and CLR-based data types.
- Casting to and from JSON data type is not supported yet. The workaround is to first convert from/to **nvarchar(max)** and then to/from JSON. For example, to convert a vector to a JSON type:

    ```sql
    DECLARE @v VECTOR(3) = '[1.0, -0.2, 30]';
    SELECT CAST(CAST(@v AS NVARCHAR(MAX)) AS JSON) AS j;
    ```
    
    and to convert from a JSON type to vector:
    
    ```sql
    DECLARE @j JSON = JSON_ARRAY(1.0, -0.2, 30)
    SELECT CAST(CAST(@j AS NVARCHAR(MAX)) AS VECTOR(3)) AS v;
    ```
    
### Indexes

- B-tree indexes or columnstore indexes are not allowed on **vector** columns. However, a **vector** column can be specified as an included column in an index definition.

### User-defined types

- Creation of alias type using `CREATE TYPE` for the **vector** type isn't allowed, similar to the behavior of the **xml** and **json** data types.

### Ledger tables

- Stored procedure `sp_verify_database_ledger` will generate an error if the database contains a table with a **vector** column.

## Known issues

In the ongoing preview there are the following known issues:

- Tools like SQL Server Management Studio, Azure Data Studio, or the mssql extension for VS Code currently might not be able to generate the script of a table that has a column using the **vector** data type.
- Tools like SQL Server Management Studio, Azure Data Studio, or the mssql extension for VS Code currently might report a data type of **varbinary** instead of **vector** for a column using the **vector** type.
- BCP and `BULK INSERT` don't currently work if tables contain the **vector** type.
- Import and Export via DacFx currently doesn't work if there is a table using **vector** type.
- Column encryption doesn't currently support the **vector** type.
- Always Encrypted doesn't currently support the **vector** type.
- Data Masking currently shows **vector** data as **varbinary** data type in the portal.

These issues will be fixed in future updates and documentation will be updated accordingly.
